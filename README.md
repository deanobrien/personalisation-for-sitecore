![Personalisation for Sitecore](https://deanobrien.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/personalisation-small.png)

This is a simple set of MVC controllers and actions, that enable you to build a Sitecore website using Twitter BootStrap components.

The purpose of the site is to provide a framework to demonstrate basic Personalisation (using features such as content profiling, device detection and campaigns based rules.)

To use:

1) Provision a vanilla Sitecore 10.3 XP0 Sitecore
2) Clone and build the repo
3) Place DLLs into Bin Folder (also include GlassMapper and Castle.Core DLLs)
4) Place views and config files in correct locations
5) Either install the package Personalisation.1.zip from root or copy Serialisation folder to App_Data and serialise via content editor.
6) Publish site and navigate
